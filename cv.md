## Sokolovskaia Anna
**Junior Frontend Developer**

Attentive to detail and results-oriented, I am interested in creating interactive, user-friendly, accessible and multifunctional websites. 
I gained some knowledge relevant to this field by self-studying and going through some courses. But I am willing to get more professional experience, so seeking for an entry-level position to use and improve my skills, troubleshoot problems and help complete projects on time.
